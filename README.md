# Nike-Clone

A front-end clone of the official Nike website built for practice. This project was created to improve my frontend development skills by replicating the design, layout, and responsiveness of the Nike homepage â€” all done with pure code, without using any frameworks or libraries.


### Features

1. Clean and modern UI inspired by Nikeâ€™s official website
2. Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
3. Navigation bar with dropdowns (if included)
4. Product sections and promotional banners
5. Hover effects and interactive elements


### Technologies Used

HTML5 & CSS3
(No frameworks or libraries used â€” pure vanilla code!)
